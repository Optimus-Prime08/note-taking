I will create the following files:

1. index.html: The main HTML file that will contain the structure of the note-taking app.
2. styles.css: The CSS file that will contain the styling for the note-taking app.
3. main.js: The JavaScript file that will contain the main logic for the note-taking app, including the Note, NotesManager, and UI classes, as well as the event listeners.

index.html
